            <p class="p-gal">The science of weather forecasting falls to public scrutiny every single day. When the
                forecast is correct, we rarely comment, but we are often quick to complain when the forecast is wrong.
                Are we ever likely to achieve a perfect forecast that is accurate to the hour?</p>

            </figure>
            <p class="p-gal">Meteorologists are able to predict the changes in weather patterns by using several
                different tools. They use these tools to measure atmospheric conditions that occurred in the past and
                present, and they apply this information to create educated guesses about the future weather. Always
                remember that a weather forecast is an educated guess – meteorologists (and mankind, in general) cannot
                control the weather. The best we can do is observe past and present atmospheric patterns and data, and
                apply this information to what we think will happen in the future. Meteorologists use the scientific
                method on a daily – and even hourly – basis!</p>

            <p class="p-gal">An extreme weather event or climate disaster has occurred every day, on average, somewhere
                in the world over the last 50 years, marking a five-fold increase over that period, a new UN analysis
                shows. Each extreme weather and climate-related disaster carried an average economic loss of a
                staggering $383 million, according to the report by the World Meteorological Organization. The economic
                toll of these disasters has climbed seven-fold since the 1970s.</p>

                recent video of a rare sandstorm in northwestern São Paulo, Brazil. As the choking cloud rushed past the
                camera, it transformed the city skyline into a scene that would have looked right at home in the arid
                wasteland of the post-apocalyptic "Mad Max" movies.</p>

            <p class="p-gal">The study displays a new method of remotely monitoring the plasma in the ionosphere and of
                controlling wave modes in a way which could help GPS make better calculations in the face of extreme
                space weather. The researchers conducted a controlled radar wave experiment by injecting radio waves
                into the ionosphere, at slightly different frequencies.</p>

            <p class="p-gal">Italy may have just recorded the hottest temperature in European history, according to
                preliminary reports from local meteorologists. And perhaps fittingly, the culprit of the heat wave has
                been named Lucifer. Syracuse, a city on the coast of the Italian island of Sicily, registered
                temperatures of 119.85 degrees Fahrenheit (48.8 degrees Celsius) on Wednesday (Aug. 11). If the
                measurement is confirmed by the World Meteorological Organization, it will break the previous European
                record of 118.4 F (48 C) recorded in Athens in 1977.</p>

            <p class="p-gal">Beijing has been enveloped in one of its most severe sandstorms in over a decade, which has
                combined with air pollution to create a toxic, gritty haze that turned skies orange and made the skyline
                disappear. The sandstorm hit the Chinese capital on Monday morning (March 15) after gale-force winds
                from Mongolia blew dust from the Gobi desert over the border. In Mongolia, 341 people are missing after
                the same sandstorm blew across the country, according to The Guardian.</p>

            <p class="p-gal">A new satellite image has captured the stunning white peaks of two volcanoes on the Big
                Island in Hawaii, which have experienced their second-most extensive snow coverage since current records
                began. The high-resolution image — snapped on Feb. 6 by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard the
                Landsat-8 satellite — shows the striking contrast between the snow-covered peaks of Mauna Kea and Mauna
                Loa and the surrounding volcanic rock.</p>
